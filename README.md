**Roo-AINovel** is a VSCode plugin for AI-assisted novel creation developed from [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code). It transforms Roo Code's intelligent code editing capabilities into a novel creation assistance tool, helping authors with conceptualization, outline generation, chapter writing, and content refinement.

## Project Origin

Roo-AINovel is based on Roo Code (a VSCode plugin for AI-powered intelligent code editing) and extends its powerful AI assistance capabilities from the realm of code editing to literary creation. We have maintained the core architecture and AI interaction capabilities of the original project while redesigning the interface, tools, and functionalities to fully adapt to the novel creation process.
